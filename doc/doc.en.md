### Project Concept:
The project is inspired by the movie "In Time" and Airbnb. In the world of "In Time," time itself is currency and can be traded, while Airbnb is about renting out unused space. We aim to create a service for renting out one's available time, similar to an Airbnb for time.

### Project Details:
The project involves three roles: the platform operator, the service provider, and the service purchaser.

#### Service Provider:
* **Offer Services**
  Service providers are individuals offering their time. After registering an account, they will receive a deposit address and can start posting services. For example, if someone is familiar with Taipei's cuisine, they could rent out a day to guide someone through Taipei's best eats, offer their morning time for queueing services, share their knowledge as a local guide in Thailand for two days, offer programming lessons during their evenings, or consult on weekends...etc. The main idea is to rent out one's spare time.
* **Start Service**
  When starting the service, the purchasing party will provide a random code for the service provider to enter, which begins the service. At the end of the service, it's up to the service provider to mark the service as complete.
* **End Service**
  After the service ends, the purchaser submits a review. Following this, a POAP is minted, and the service provider can withdraw their fees through the POAP.

#### Service Purchaser:
* **Purchase Services**
  Service purchasers can browse through the services offered by providers on the platform. After registering and logging in, the platform will provide a deposit address for the purchaser to deposit USDT, after which they can purchase the service. The purchase will be minted into an NFT and sent to the purchaser's deposit address.
* **Start Service**
  When starting the service, the platform will display a random code which the purchaser provides to the service provider to initiate the service.
* **End Service**
  After the service ends, submit a review.
* **Secondary Market**
  Purchasers can buy and sell NFT tickets on the secondary market, with a percentage of each transaction fee going back to the service provider.

#### Service Platform
* **Platform Services**
  * Allows users to add, modify, or delete services.
  * Enables users to purchase services and mint them into NFT tickets.
  * Provides a secondary market for buying and selling NFT tickets.
  * Offers wallet services.
  * Mints POAPs for service providers.
  * Issues tokens and provides a curve exchange service.


### Tokenomics:
The platform will issue its own token, initially limiting its circulation, and establishing a value relationship through a token/USDT exchange curve.

#### Issuance Mechanism
1. A percentage of the initial issuance will be subscribed by blue-chip investors.
2. Suppose a completed service costs 100 USDT, the platform will take a 10% commission (10 USDT) to buy tokens through the curve, distributing 3% of the tokens to the service provider, 3% to the service purchaser, and 4% to the platform. This exchange mechanism will be used to issue tokens. In the future, service purchasers can use these tokens for discounts, while both service providers and purchasers can earn APY through staking.
#### Jury System
By purchasing and staking tokens, users can qualify for jury duty. In the event of service disputes, they can participate in the adjudication process and receive a percentage of the service fee as compensation.
